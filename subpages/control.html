          <h4>Learn from Mistakes:</h4>
        <p>Understand that setbacks and slips in self-control are normal. Instead of dwelling on failures, focus on learning from them. Analyze what went wrong, adjust your approach if needed, and use these experiences as opportunities for growth.</p>
        
        <p>Remember that self-control is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way.</p>
